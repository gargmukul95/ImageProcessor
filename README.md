# ImageProcessor

Introduction

Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they've hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90째 and too large. Oof! You're not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.
What you'll do

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

    Open an image
    Rotate an image
    Resize an image
    Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory

Download the file

Your design contractor sent you the zipped file through his team drive. Download the file from the drive using the following CURL request:

curl -c ./cookie -s -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=$11hg55-dKdHN63yJP20dMLAgPJ5oiTOHF" > /dev/null | curl -Lb ./cookie "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=`awk '/download/ {print $NF}' ./cookie`&id=11hg55-dKdHN63yJP20dMLAgPJ5oiTOHF" -o images.zip && sudo rm -rf cookie


Unzip the file using the following command:

unzip images.zip

Navigate to the images folder using the following command:

cd images

To list images use the following command:

ls

The images received are in the wrong format:

    A: .tiff format
    B: Image resolution 192x192 pixel (too large)
    C: Rotated 90째 anti-clockwise


The images required for the launch should be in this format:

    A: .jpeg format

    B: Image resolution 128x128 pixel

    C:Should be straight
    
# Install Pillow

We should change the format and size of these pictures, and rotate them by 90째 clockwise. To do this, we'll use Python Imaging Library (PIL). Install pillow library using the following command:

pip3 install pillow

Python Imaging Library (known as Pillow in newer versions) is a library in Python that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving lots of different image file formats.

Pillow offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:

    Per-pixel manipulations
    Masking and transparency handling
    Image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding
    Image enhancing, like sharpening and adjusting brightness, contrast or color
    Adding text to images (and much more!)
    
 # Writing Python Script
    
    This is the challenge section of the lab where you'll write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:

    Iterate through each file in the folder
    For each file:
        Rotate the image 90째 clockwise
        Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
        Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format

Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/

You'll use lots of methods from PIL to complete this exercise. You can refer to Pillow for detailed explanations and have a look at the tutorials to help you build the script and complete the task.

To save the file after editing, press Ctrl-O, Enter, and Ctrl-x.

On a successful run, this should produce images in the right format within the directory: /opt/icons/
